THE KABBALAH.


I.


A system of religious philosophy, or more properly of theosophy, which
has not only exercised for hundreds of years an extraordinary influence
on the mental development of so shrewd a people as the Jews, but has
captivated the minds of some of the greatest thinkers of Christendom in
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, claims the greatest attention
of both the philosopher and the theologian. When it is added that among
its captives were Raymond Lully, the celebrated scholastic,
metaphysician and chemist (died 1315); John Reuchlin, the renowned
scholar and reviver of oriental literature in Europe (born 1455, died
1522); John Picus di Mirandola, the famous philosopher and classical
scholar (1463–1494); Cornelius Henry Agrippa, the distinguished
philosopher, divine and physician (1486–1535); John Baptist von
Helmont, a remarkable chemist and physician (1577–1644); as well as our
own countrymen Robert Fludd, the famous physician and philosopher
(1574–1637), and Dr. Henry More (1614–1687); and that these men, after
restlessly searching for a scientific system which should disclose to
them “the deepest depths” of the Divine nature, and show them the real
tie which binds all things together, found the cravings of their minds
satisfied by this theosophy, the claims of the Kabbalah on the
attention of students in literature and philosophy will readily be
admitted. The claims of the Kabbalah, however, are not restricted to
the literary man and the philosopher: the poet too will find in it
ample materials for the exercise of his lofty genius. How can it be
otherwise with a theosophy which, we are assured, was born of God in
Paradise, was nursed and reared by the choicest of the angelic hosts in
heaven, and only held converse with the holiest of man’s children upon
earth. Listen to the story of its birth, growth and maturity, as told
by its followers.
