## Built with

This project has been built with Java at IntelliJ IDE.

## Getting Started

Once you have cloned the repository there is no configuration you need to do.
All the run files are already configured, but if you have any problem on executing some test or pyhton file you need to write in the program arguments of the file the following sentence.

## Usage 

In this implementation you will see two Main classes, one for each module (invertedIndex and crawler). To execute the software, firstly you will need to run the crawler to be able to execute the invertedIndex, as it needs the datalake.
